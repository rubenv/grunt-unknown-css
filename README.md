## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-unknown-css --save-dev
```

One the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-unknown-css');
```

## The "unknown_css" task

Detect undeclared CSS classes in your HTML.

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `unknown_css` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  unknown_css: {
    all: {
      files: ['views/*.html', 'css/*.css']
    }
  },
})
```

This will parse all the class names from the css files in the `css` folder and match them with all the HTML files in the `views` folder. Any class name that's used in the HTML files, which doesn't exist in the CSS files, will be shown.

### Options

#### options.whitelist
Type: `Array`
Default value: `[]`

A set of class names that should be allowed, even though they don't exist in the CSS files. You can also supply regexes here.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  unknown_css: {
    options: {
      whitelist: [ 'valid', /\{\{.*\}\}/ ]
    },
    all: {
      files: ['views/*.html', 'css/*.css']
    }
  },
})
```

The whitelist above will allow the use of the `valid` class, as well as classes such as `icon-{{name}}`.
